### How to run test scripts
In order to run the test scripts you will need to clone this repo in your homework repo:
```
$ cd <your homework repo directory>
$ git clone https://github.com/BhavanaPandey1/Testing_PA3/tree/main

You can then run all the checks and tests by calling:
```
$ bash BhavanaPandey1/Testing_PA3.sh all
$ bash BhavanaPandey1/Testing_PA3.sh all
```

Or you can run an individual check or test by calling:
```
$ bash <path to BhavanaPandey1/Testing_PA3.sh <check number>
$ bash <path to BhavanaPandey1/Testing_PA3.sh <test number>
